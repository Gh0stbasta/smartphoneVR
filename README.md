# Smartphone VR Learning Project with Unity & Google Cardboard

This project is designed to learn **VR development with Unity** â€“  
specifically for Android smartphones in a VR headset (Google Cardboard compatible).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This project will cover the following elements:

1. **Unity XR Basics**  
   - Integrate Google Cardboard XR Plugin  
   - Use gyroscope-based head tracking  
   - Set up stereoscopic rendering  

2. **Video in VR**  
   - Display MP4 as a texture in 3D space  
   - Control play/pause via VR UI   

3. **Shaders & Masking**  
   - Create a chroma key shader (make a color transparent)  
   - Control transparency with a UI slider  

4. **Passthrough Simulation**  
   - Use smartphone camera as VR background  
   - Overlay video with transparency-based compositing  

5. **Basic Streaming**  
   - Send PC video via UDP to the smartphone  
   - Receive and display in Unity  

6. **VR UI Interaction**  
   - Gaze/tap-based menus  
   - Adjust parameters live (key color, transparency)
