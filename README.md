## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project will cover the following elements:

1. **Unity XR Basics**  
   - Integrate Google Cardboard XR Plugin  
   - Use gyroscope-based head tracking  
   - Set up stereoscopic rendering  

2. **Video in VR**  
   - Display MP4 as a texture in 3D space  
   - Control play/pause via VR UI   

3. **Shaders & Masking**  
   - Create a chroma key shader (make a color transparent)  
   - Control transparency with a UI slider  

4. **Passthrough Simulation**  
   - Use smartphone camera as VR background  
   - Overlay video with transparency-based compositing  

5. **Basic Streaming**  
   - Send PC video via UDP to the smartphone  
   - Receive and display in Unity  

6. **VR UI Interaction**  
   - Gaze/tap-based menus  
   - Adjust parameters live (key color, transparency)

## üê≥ Development Environment

This repository includes a **VS Code Dev Container** for docs, scripting, tooling (FFmpeg, Node, Python), linting/formatting, and Git operations. Unity/Android builds run natively on your host.

**To use the Dev Container:**
1. Open this repository in VS Code
2. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** (or use Command Palette ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container")
3. VS Code will build the container and install recommended extensions automatically

**Environment setup:**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your local settings
- The Dev Container includes Python, Node.js, and development tools
- Unity Editor should be installed and run on your host system

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Put the smartphone into **developer mode** & enable USB debugging  
2. In Unity ‚Üí **Build Settings ‚Üí Android**  
3. Connect the USB cable and select *Build & Run*  
4. Test the app in the VR headset
